This folder contains a set of tool that I wrote to help me doing some tasks
related to reverse engineering. They are just quick & dirty attempts at solving
a particular problem and they work for that. However none of them represent
what a finished product should look like. Error handling is minimal or even
absent, so you must be very careful when using them.
