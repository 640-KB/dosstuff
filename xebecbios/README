This directory contains the BIOS for the IBM-provided Xebec MFM controller.
There were several versions of this controller:

- (Supported!) Variation #1: this officially supports only the Seagate
  ST-412 drive.
- (Should work) Variation #2: a more integrated version, but otherwise
  identical. Even though this should work the same as #1, I don't have
  it and thus cannot test if it works.
- (Coming soon!) Variation #3 (also known as "20MB Fixed Disk Drive
  Adapter"): This will be supported soon. Its BIOS is basically the
  same except that is does have switches to select different drive
  geometries and also the code has been greatly improved. Will be
  supported very soon.

Since the hardware seems to be the same between the 3 versions, except the
switches, I intend to have a single source code for all of them. I also
plan to include dynamic geometry and a friendly way of performing a
low-level format as is available with other controllers.
